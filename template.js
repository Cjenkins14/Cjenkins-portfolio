    <p>My first project using Javascript and jQuery, this quiz app allows you to test your knowledge
    about an obscure island in the Great Lakes. This was inspired by a summer I spent working there, after I learned that most people
    outside the state don't know it exists.</p> <br />

    <p>PackIt was designed to help travelers by creating a checklist for their packing needs. 
    The app uses the weatherBit API to find the weather conditions around the globe, and renders a packing list based upon those weather conditions. 
    All that is needed is the postal code of the area you are traveling to and the dates that you will be there, the app does the rest.

    <p>Recruitr was designed for college baseball recruiters, to minimize the work they do off the field. 
    Users are able to create profiles for their recruits, storing contact information, stats and embed a video for each player. 
    This solves the problem of using various apps and communication types to discuss and keep track of prospective recruits. </p>

  about: ` <div class="contain-content">
    <p>A few years ago, I completed my first Raspberry Pi project using Python. 
    I became very interested in what I could accomplish if I knew how to write software. Some of my natural skills 
    are attention to detail, having an eye for efficiency, and being an avid learner. I felt that these would shine 
    within the development field. I enjoy coding because solving problems and seeing my solutions come to life is exciting. I am
    ready to work with a team of great programmers and excited for what I can learn.
    When I am not losing myself in learning a new language or project I am likely traveling, enjoying time outdoors, or reading.</p>
