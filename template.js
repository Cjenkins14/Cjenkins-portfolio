    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first project using Javascript and jQuery, this quiz app allows you to test your knowledge
    about an obscure island in the Great Lakes. This was inspired by a summer I spent working there, after I learned that most people
    outside the state don't know it exists.</p></div>`,
    about: ` <div class="contain-content">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago, I completed my first Raspberry Pi project using Python. 
    I became very interested in what I could accomplish if I knew how to write software. Some of my natural skills 
    are attention to detail, having an eye for efficiency, and being an avid learner. I felt that these would shine 
    within the development field. I enjoy coding because solving problems and seeing my solutions come to life is exciting. I am
    ready to work with a team of great programmers and excited for what I can learn.
    When I am not losing myself in learning a new language or project I am likely traveling, enjoying time outdoors, or reading.</p>
