    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago, I completed my first Raspberry Pi project, using Python. I became very interested in 
    what I could accomplish if I knew how to write my own software. When I realized that I needed to change 
    my career, I had to decide what type of problem I wanted to handle in my everyday life. Some of my natural 
    skills are attention to detail, an eye for efficiency, and being an avid learner. I felt that these would 
    shine within the development field. I enjoy coding because solving problems, and having the benefit of seeing 
    my work come to life is exciting. When I am not losing myself in learning a new language or project, I am likely 
    traveling, enjoying time outdoors, or writing poetry.</p>
