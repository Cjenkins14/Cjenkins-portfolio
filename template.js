    about an obscure island in the Great Lakes. This was inspired by a summer I spent working there. <br></p>

    about: ` <div class="contain-content">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago, I completed my first Raspberry Pi project using Python. 
    I became very interested in what I could accomplish if I knew how to write my software. When I realized that 
    I needed to change my career, I had to decide what type of problem I wanted to handle in my everyday life. 
    Some of my natural skills are attention to detail, having an eye for efficiency, and being an avid learner. 
    I felt that these would shine within the development field. I enjoy coding because solving problems, and 
    having the benefit of seeing my work come to life is exciting. When I am not losing myself in learning a new 
    language or project, I am likely traveling, enjoying time outdoors, or reading.</p>
